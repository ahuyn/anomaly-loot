# Intro

Adds lootboxes to the game.

Lootboxes have a chance to spawn in stashes and on dead stalkers. Each lootbox will generally describe its contents, but it is randomized.

In order to open the box, drag lockpicks over the box. Boxes have a difficulty corresponding to amount of lockpicks required to open.

New game not required, as everything is handled dynamically. MCM support present. If you want to uninstall get rid of all the boxes and picks you have.

Other mod makers can integrate with lootboxes, adding items they have created into lootboxes. Consult custom_loot for usage information.

# Changelog
2.1
- Lockpick set no longer required as intermediary item. Lockpicks can be used immediately to open boxes.
- As a consequence of this, lockpick set is now a rare drop that has a different effect. Lockpick bundle is now a loot-only item.
- Lockpick cost increased.
- Technicians can open boxes for a cost.
2.0 - Major changes
- Note: Some old boxes might break. Don't worry, it won't crash your game.
- System for determining loot overhauled majorly. Expect much more random spead of items now.
- Box drops expanded greatly for each level.
- Box contents expanded greatly.
- Boxes can drop in underground levels.

    - Field Equipment Case
    - Competition Rifle Case
- Box weight now based on contents. Condition is re-added to boxes purely to enable item picker, allowing you to pick which box to open.
- PDA spawning improved. Now the PDA is based on where you find the box, instead of where you open it.
- Support for multiple unique drops instead of being instanced to one per box type. It is now possible to add your own custom uniques.
- Loot quantity off stalkers and randomly in stashes has been adjusted.
- Money from lootboxes now drops in usable stacks. Make it rain!

1.2 - Major changes:
- Documents are made to be much more valuable. Documents sell for much higher overall, and certain factions will pay more for each document type.
- Lootbox content balance pass. Partial items now spawn and overall quantity of items reduced. Repair items, weapon and outfit parts, tools, and other items added to the lootbox pool.
- Internal refactoring to add new systems for determining loot drops.
- Lootboxes rebalanced to follow a smoother progression. Survival caches are easier to break into and offer less high value loot, briefcases increased in difficulty.
- Added a snapgun as a rare drop. Snapguns will open low condition boxes for free.
